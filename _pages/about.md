I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Division of Clinical Informatics and Digital Transformation in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Prior to this, I was/am an Assistant Professor in the Information & Computer Sciences department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa until January 2025. Prior to this role, I completed my PhD in Bioengineering at Stanford University, MS in Computer Science at Stanford University, and BA in Computer Science at Rice University. <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:rn871vb3166/Stanford_University_Bioengineering_PhD_Thesis__Peter_Washington%20-%20FinalFinal-augmented.pdf" target="_blank">You can read my PhD thesis here.</a>

My research interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, human-centered computing, artificial intelligence / machine learning, and data science. I am interested in applying these methods to a variety of healthcare problems based on my personal interests and the passions of the clinical informaticians whom I train in my research lab.
