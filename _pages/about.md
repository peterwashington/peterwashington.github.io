My research consists of the use of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) to develop novel digital diagnostics, screening tools, therapeutics, and interventions for a wide range of health conditions that I or my trainees care about. Our projects are focused on consumer digital health informatics, or the use of data from consumer devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, other wearables (think Oura ring for example), and consumer health devices (think blood pressure or glucose monitors for example) to derive actionable health insights.
