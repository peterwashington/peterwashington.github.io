The Hawai ªi Digital Health Lab has projects in the following areas. If you are interested in participating in existing projects or have a proposal for a new project, please contact me.


**Machine Learning for Healthcare**
------
We develop deep learning methods and datasets to support diagnostics, longitudinal outcome tracking, and adaptive health. Example projects:

* [Improved Digital Therapy for Developmental Pediatrics Using Domain-Specific Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Study](https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e26760 "Journal of Medical Internet Research")
* [Training Affective Computer Vision Models by Crowdsourcing Soft-Target Labels](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-021-09936-4 "Cognitive Computation")


**Crowdsourcing for Precision Health**
------
We create human-in-the-loop systems to accelerate remote diagnostics and longitudinal outcome tracking for complex neuropsychiatric conditions. Example projects:

* [Crowdsourced privacy-preserved feature tagging of short home videos for machine learning ASD detection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87059-4 "Scientific Reports")
* [Crowd annotations can approximate clinical autism impressions from short home videos with privacy protections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666521222000096 "Intelligence-Based Medicine")


**Digital Interventions for Health and Wellbeing**
------
We develop mobile, web, wearable, augmented reality, and virtual reality interventions for psychiatric, developmental, and behavioral conditions. Example projects:

* [Superpowerglass: A wearable aid for the at-home therapy of children with autism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3130977 "IMWUT")
* [A wearable social interaction aid for children with autism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2851581.2892282 "CHI Extended Abstracts")
