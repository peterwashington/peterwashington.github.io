This is a discussion-based course covering the latest research in human-centered artificial intellgience (HAI). Topics covered include: interactive ML systems, explainable & interpretable ML, AI for healthcare, fairness & bias, privacy, crowdsourcing, HCI evaluations of AI-powered systems, and ethical frameworks applied to AI. Coursework includes in-class discussions and presentations, research paper reading assignments with weekly structured one-page reflections, developing a structured project proposal with preliminary data, and writing a three-page review of one of the topics discussed.

Recommended prerequisites to get the most out of this course include ICS 235 (Machine Learning Methods), ICS 434 (Data Science Fundamentals), and ICS 435 (Machine Learning Fundamentals).
