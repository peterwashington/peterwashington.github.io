This is a discussion-based course covering the latest research in human-centered artificial intellgience (HAI). Topics covered include: interactive ML systems, explainable & interpretable ML, AI for healthcare, fairness & bias, privacy, crowdsourcing, HCI evaluations of AI-powered systems, and ethical frameworks applied to AI. 

**Coursework:** Coursework includes in-class discussions and presentations, research paper reading assignments with weekly structured one-page reflections, developing a structured project proposal with preliminary data, and writing a three-page review of one of the topics discussed.

**Grading:** Grading will consist of a combination of a written work, presentations, and participation. Specifically, the breakdown is as follows:
* a
* a
* a
* In-class presentations: 20%
* Participation and attendance: 20%

Recommended prerequisites to get the most out of this course include ICS 235 (Machine Learning Methods), ICS 434 (Data Science Fundamentals), and ICS 435 (Machine Learning Fundamentals).
